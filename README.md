# M.O.G. Script snippets 🎉

Emojis are all around us and so the fun can grow! 😀 🍾 Have fun!

- Convert the JavaScript keywords in your code to emojis.
- Write faster emojified code using the predefined snippets.
- Add this [webpack loader](https://github.com/mog-script/mog-script-loader) to your configuration and let the emojis live in your project, the loader will transpile them back to standard JavaScript.

🚨 DISCLAMER: Do not use this package on production code! We are not responsible if your boss or colleagues gets 😱 angry 😡 when they see emojis in your JS code 😀 🙃
